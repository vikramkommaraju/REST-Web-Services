To deploy the war, you need to make sure GlassFish server and Derby server BOTH are up and running.

To start GlassFish server, look at Caveats.txt of EJB
TO start derby, make sure derby is installed and then run startNetworkServer script
This will start a network server listening on port 1527

If you dont start derby, you will see error deploying the war to GlassFish

[vkommara::REST-Web-Services]>asadmin deploy target/rest-1.0.war

After derby is up
