To deploy the war, you need to make sure GlassFish server and Derby server BOTH are up and running.

To start GlassFish server, look at Caveats.txt of EJB
TO start derby, make sure derby is installed and then run startNetworkServer script
This will start a network server listening on port 1527

If you dont start derby, you will see error deploying the war to GlassFish

[vkommara::REST-Web-Services]>asadmin deploy target/rest-1.0.war 
remote failure: Error occurred during deployment: Exception while preparing the app : Exception [EclipseLink-4002] (Eclipse Persistence Services - 2.5.2.v20140319-9ad6abd): org.eclipse.persistence.exceptions.DatabaseException
Internal Exception: java.sql.SQLException: Error in allocating a connection. Cause: Connection could not be allocated because: java.net.ConnectException : Error connecting to server localhost on port 1527 with message Connection refused.
Error Code: 0. Please see server.log for more details.
Command deploy failed.

After derby is up

[vkommara::REST-Web-Services]>asadmin deploy target/rest-1.0.war 
Application deployed with name rest-1.0.
Command deploy executed successfully.
[vkommara::REST-Web-Services]>

After the war is deployed, you can either use a rest client like Jersey or you can use the cURL command line
